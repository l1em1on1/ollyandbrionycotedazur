        <h2>Alternative Transport</h2>
        <p>Clearly Olly knows a thing or two about avoiding a flight! Therefore if you want to discuss alternative ways of travelling down Olly would be more than happy to discuss the best ways of getting there without setting foot on a plane!</p>

        <h3>Driving &amp; taking the train are both viable options.</h3>
        <img src="../images/gettingthere/driving.jpg" alt="driving" />
        <p>Driving takes approximately 13 hours from London (although significantly more with children and can be significantly less if one takes a loose attitude to the speed limit!). We would recommend taking the Eurotunnel from Folkstone to Calais which
            has a crossing time of 35 minutes rather than 1hr15 on the ferry. Sat Nav can guide you pretty well however be sure not to take the route via Paris, we follow the route of Arras, Saint Quentin, Reims, Dijon, Lyon, Avignon, Ste Maxime (Look
            this up on a map for road numbers).</p>

        <img src="../images/gettingthere/train.jpg" alt="train" />
        <p>You can now also take a Eurostar all the way from London to Avignon in Provence. It takes about 6 hours. From there you can either hire a car and drive the rest of the way (+/- 2 hours), or get a connecting train to Frejus which is about a 30
            minute drive from Ste Maxime.</p>

        <h2>Getting from Nice to Sainte Maxime</h2>
        <p>We would recommend renting a car, which will be less expensive than a taxi. Car rentals are available from Nice Côte d'Azur Airport.</p>
        <p>Taxis: A pre booked taxi will cost between €160-200 one way.</p>
        <p>It is possible to hail taxis from outside the airport but they will be very expensive.</p>

        <h3>Driving directions from Nice to Sainte Maxime - approx. 1hr 10 mins</h3>
        <img src="../images/gettingthere/directions.jpg" alt="directions" />
        <p>Take the A8 (towards Aix-en-Provence/Toulon/Marseille) for around 68 kms, getting off at exit 36 and follow directions to Sainte Maxime and Saint Tropez. Follow the D25 for roughly 25 kms and you will come into the centre of Sainte Maxime.</p>
