        <h2>Friday Evening</h2>
        <p>For those who arrive on Friday we will be a hosting a very informal drinks party &amp; BBQ at the Myerson house in Les Issambres. The address for those who wish to drive is 701 Impasse Des Driades, Les Issambres 83380, France (we would strongly
            recommend using a Sat-Nav or we can provide directions on request). We will also be putting on transport from Ste Maxime at the beginning of the night and back again later. Times and exact location for the coach pick up will be confirmed closer
            to the time.</p>
        <p>On the RSVP page you will be asked to confirm whether or not you will be attending the Friday night party so that we can gauge numbers. Please do not feel obliged if you just want to do your own thing on Friday night, as a couple with young children
            we know only too well how precious it is to get some time to yourselves!</p>

        <h2>Saturday Morning</h2>
        <p>No late afternoon wedding would be complete without the groom playing a boy’s round of golf early on Saturday morning. We will be playing at Sainte Maxime Golf Course (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amarantegolfplaza.com/golf/">www.amarantegolfplaza.com/golf/</a>),
            a challenging course with a stunning elevated back 9 offering views over the Bay of St Tropez. The round is likely to cost between 80 – 100 Euros including a buggy (which is compulsory owing to the steep course).</p>
        <p>This invite is open to any of the boys/men attending the wedding (sorry girls), please can you let Olly know directly on <a target="_blank" href="mailto:omyerson@hotmail.co.uk">omyerson@hotmail.co.uk</a> by 15th April if you wish to join.</p>

        <h2>Sunday</h2>
        <p>For those still around on Sunday, Olly and Briony are likely to take an area at one of the local beach bars to carry on the festivities, although we unfortunately are unable to pick up the tab.</p>
        <p>For those wishing to continue the party with another afternoon/evening of sun &amp; sand, eating, drinking and dancing on the Cote D’Azur we would love you to join us! Venue/timings to be confirmed but likely to be in Ste Maxime somewhere for
            easy &amp; convenient access.</p>
