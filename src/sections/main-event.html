        <h2>Timings &amp; Transport</h2>
        <p>The wedding ceremony will take place at 17:00 on Saturday 9th July at Prao Plage, Avenue du Général Touzet Duvigier, Sainte-Maxime (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.praoplage.com">www.praoplage.com</a>)</p>
        <p>Coaches will be provided to bring guests from the centre of Ste Maxime at 16:30. Please meet in front of L’Amiral restaurant, Quartier Port, 83120 Ste-Maxime. This restaurant is in the port, next to the ferry to St Tropez and noticeable by the
            large sign above it. Please meet here no later than 16:25, where you will be directed onto a coach.</p>
        <p>A coach will also be provided to bring those staying at/close to the Myerson’s house or in Les Issambres to the venue. Details of this will be provided separately to anyone who ends up staying in that area.</p>
        <p>At the end of the night the bar will shut at 01:30 with the reception finishing officially at 02:00. Between 11:30 and 02:00/02:15 we will be providing coaches back to the centre of Ste Maxime and also to Les Issambres. Please make sure you don’t
            miss the last coach or you could be stranded!</p>

        <h2>Dress Code - Cote D’Azur Cool</h2>
        <p>Boys - no ties.</p>
        <p>Girls (and boys if you’re so inclined) – given that this is a beach wedding heels may be a little challenging and you might consider wedges, flats or flipflops. Saying that, by all means wear heels and feel free to just take them off for walking
            on the sand!</p>
        <p>You might also want to bring a jumper for the evening in case the sea breeze gets a little cool.</p>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>The menu has not yet been finalised but please note we are likely to serve fish.</p>
        <p>If you would rather the vegetarian option, or if you have any particular dietary requirements we should know about, please let us know on the RSVP page.</p>
        <p>There will be a children’s menu on the day comprising a burger and chips. Again if you want your child to have a vegetarian option please let us know.</p>

        <h2>Gifts</h2>
        <p>Your presence is enough without presents! Please don’t feel obliged to give us anything.</p>
        <p>However if you do wish to give us something, we really don’t need anything from a traditional gift list, as those of you who have been to our house will know the only thing we need is more space! We are planning on doing an extension to the house
            next year and have therefore set up a gift fund that allows people to contribute small amounts to that. Again, please don’t feel obliged, but of course any contributions will be hugely appreciated!</p>
        <p>To access the gift fund, please go to the following website <a target="_blank" href="http://www.honeyfund.co.uk/wedding/Brolly2016">http://www.honeyfund.co.uk/wedding/Brolly2016</a></p>
